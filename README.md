Exploring and testing of programming a Multiplayer space shooter game. The engine used is a work-in-progress homemade engine called "Nautilus" (not publicly available).

## Current State
### The pictures showcase 4 clients connected to 1 server.
### Device input works as expected with a Gamepad(Xbox), Keyboard and Mouse.
### When a ship is moved in one client, the same client ship is updated accordingly in all clients.
